 * Returns the Pi-secret Ed25519 keypair, generating + persisting one on
 * first call. Resolution order:
 *   1. Existing file `~/.pi/remote/identity.json`, if present — it WINS over
 *      the keyring. A file identity is only ever written by the headless/
 *      degraded fallback (step 4) or an explicit `REMOTE_PI_ALLOW_FILE_IDENTITY`
 *      opt-in, so its mere presence means this machine established its identity
 *      as a file and the mobile device paired against THAT pubkey. If the
 *      platform keyring later becomes readable (D-Bus/libsecret installed, a
 *      desktop session, or a stale/other entry from another install), reading
 *      it first would mask the file identity — returning a DIFFERENT key, or
 *      (when the keyring is empty) minting a fresh one and persisting it —
 *      silently breaking the existing pairing. So when both exist, file wins.
 *   2. New keyring service `dev.remotepi.pi` (read retried — a transiently
 *      locked Keychain throws; we don't treat that as "no key")
 *   3. Old keyring service `dev.remotepi.mac` (migrate → step 2, delete old)
 *   4. Generate a fresh keypair, BUT only when it's safe to: either both
 *      keyring reads succeeded and returned nothing (genuine first run), or
 *      the keyring is genuinely unavailable on a platform without a core one
 *      (headless Linux → a file identity is minted here). On macOS/Windows a
 *      persistent read failure with no file identity throws
 *      `KeyringUnavailableError` instead of minting a new key — generating
 *      there silently breaks existing pairing (the "lost pairing after idle"
 *      bug). `REMOTE_PI_ALLOW_FILE_IDENTITY=1` opts back into a file identity
 *      for headless macOS/Windows hosts.
 *
 * Idempotent: subsequent calls return the same identity. The migration
 * runs at most once per machine (the old entry is deleted after copy).
