 * Lifecycle:
 *   - `spawn()` boots the child with the daemon's cwd + `REMOTE_PI_DAEMON=1`
 *     env so the extension knows to skip the interactive wizard.
 *   - `sendPrompt(text)` writes a Pi RPC `prompt` command to stdin.
 *   - The child's stdout (Pi RPC events) is currently consumed line-by-line
 *     and ignored — wave 2 only needs fire-and-forget. Later waves can
 *     surface the events back through the supervisor's status op.
 *   - Exit/crash fires `exit` event with `{code, signal, isCrash}` so the
 *     supervisor can decide whether to auto-restart.
 *
 * Each `RpcChild` instance maps 1:1 to a registry entry (single cwd).
 * The supervisor owns the map of these and addresses them by `id`.

 * `--continue` is the key bit: it resumes the **most recent** session for the

 * which opens a picker). Without it every supervisor restart spun up a brand
 * new session file, piling up thousands of JSONLs per folder. With it, a
 * restart REUSES the one session; the app's `/new` (session_new) still rolls
 * it over to a fresh one, which the next restart then continues. First boot
 * (no prior session) just creates the first one.
 *
 * `--name <sessionName>`, when given, pins the session's display name to the
 * daemon's identity (its `agent_name`) so every restart shows up under the
 * same stable name in the picker/app instead of an auto-generated one. The
 * daemon's name is set at registration (`remote-pi create <cwd> --name "…"`).
 * Omitted when no name resolves, so the arg list stays minimal.
 *
 * `--approve` is mandatory for a daemon (pi ≥0.79 project trust): RPC mode is
 * non-interactive, so without an override Pi resolves an untrusted project
 * folder (any folder with `.pi/` or CLAUDE.md/AGENTS.md) to NOT trusted and
 * silently skips its `.pi/settings.json` (model/provider/keys), instructions,
 * resources and project extensions — the daemon then comes up with no model
 * and fails on the first turn. The operator already authorized this folder by
 * registering/launching a daemon in it, so `--approve` (trust-for-this-run) is
 * the correct non-interactive stance. (Does NOT affect the separate "extension
 * loaded twice" conflict, which comes from the extension being BOTH installed
 * in ~/.pi/agent/extensions or cwd/.pi/extensions AND passed via `-e`.)
